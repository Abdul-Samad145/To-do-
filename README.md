# To-do-
In this task, I created a simple To-Do List application to manage daily tasks efficiently. The main purpose of this task was to understand how to add, display, and remove items dynamically using basic programming concepts. Users can input tasks, and the system will display them in a list format. Each task has a delete and edit option.
